The source code included with this book is not only free,
but it has been tested and thoroughly checked using
Bloodshed Dev C++ 5. Dev C++ 5 is available for free at
http:\\www.bloodshed.net. I included the project files
(.dev files), so that you can open them if you do have Dev
C++, saving you some time. If you don't use Dev C++, just
open the .cpp and .h files on their own with your compiler.

If you do plan on using any big part of this code, please
make sure that you give me credit for writing it (I don't
really care if you use a line or two here or there).
Please copy the commented information at the top and of
bottom of this file into your sorce code.

The name of each file indicates which lesson in the book
the source code comes from. Example: 1.cpp is from lesson 1.
